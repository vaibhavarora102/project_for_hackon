# Self-diagnosis solution
Our goal is to create an easy way for self-diagnosis of some common disease namely COVID, typhoid, chicken_pox, pneumonia, influenza, sars, MERS, Ebola and malaria which all have similar symptoms like fever , sneezing and body-pain.  <br /> <br />
 Our application is designed is such a way it calls the user to use it. For example, Our application has the comfort of voice-based input, including multi-language support, both input and output. User can easily choose to switch between audio input and manual input with minimalistic GUI(Graphical User Interphase). <br /> <br />
It includes a basic program to give an idea of possible disease, things to avoid for that possible disease, locally available health centre.
